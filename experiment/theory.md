<p>DFA minimization is the task of transforming a given deterministic finite automaton (DFA) into an equivalent DFA that has a minimum number of states. Here, two DFAs are called equivalent if they recognize the same regular language.
</p>
The two popular methods for minimising a DFA are-

<h4>1. Minimization of DFA Using Equivalence Theorem (Partition Refinement Method):</h4>
<p>
The Equivalence Theorem provides a method for minimizing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) 
by identifying and merging equivalent states.
</p>

<p><b>Create a table of all possible state pairs:</b></p>
<li>Construct a table where rows and columns represent all states in the original DFA.</li>
<br>

<p><b>Identify initially distinguishable states:</b></p>
<li>Start by partitioning the states of the original DFA into two groups: accepting states and non-accepting states.</li>
<li>This initial partition separates states based on their acceptance behaviour.</li>

<p><b>Equivalence Class Identification:</b></p>
<li>Iterate through the partitions and identify equivalence classes by analysing transitions from states within each partition.</li>
<li>For each input symbol, determine the destination partition for the transitions from states within the current partition.</li>
<li>States that lead to the same partition for a given input symbol are considered part of the same equivalence class for that input symbol.</li>

<p><b>Merge Equivalent States:</b></p>
<li>If all states within an equivalence class are equivalent for all input symbols, merge them into a single state.</li>
<li>This merging process reduces the number of states in the DFA while preserving language recognition.</li>

<p><b>Repeat Equivalence Class Identification:</b></p>
<li>Continue the process of identifying equivalence classes until no further identifications can be made.</li>
<li>At this point, all states within a partition are part of the same equivalence class for all input symbols.</li>

<p><b>Construct Minimised DFA:</b></p>
<li>Use the merged states to construct the minimised DFA.</li>
<li>Each merged group of states, representing an equivalence class, becomes a single state in the minimised DFA.</li>

<br>

<h4>2. Minimization of DFA Using Table-Filling Method:</h4>
<p>
This is another common algorithm for DFA minimization, which works by marking distinguishable state pairs.
</p>

<p><b>Create a state-pair table:</b></p>
<li>For each pair of states (p, q), mark them as distinguishable or not.</li>

<p><b>Initialization:</b></p>
<li>Mark all pairs where one is an accepting state and the other is not (these are clearly distinguishable).</li>

<p><b>Propagation:</b></p>
<li>For unmarked pairs, check transitions for each input symbol.</li>
<li>If δ(p, a) and δ(q, a) lead to distinguishable states for some input <i>a</i>, then mark (p, q) as distinguishable.</li>

<p><b>Repeat until stable:</b></p>
<li>Continue until no more pairs can be marked as distinguishable.</li>

<p><b>Merge unmarked pairs:</b></p>
<li>States that remain unmarked are equivalent and can be merged into one state in the minimized DFA.</li>

<br>

<h5>Importance of DFA Minimization:</h5>
<li>Removes redundant states from the automaton.</li>
<li>Makes the DFA efficient for implementation in practical applications.</li>
<li>Guarantees a unique, canonical DFA for the given regular language.</li>
