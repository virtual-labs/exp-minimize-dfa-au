<h2>Aim of the experiment</h2>
<p>The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate the process of minimizing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) by eliminating redundant states, resulting in an equivalent DFA with the minimal number of states. This minimization ensures that the DFA operates efficiently while preserving its language recognition capabilities.</p>

<p>Minimizing DFAs has several practical applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Compiler Design:</strong> Minimized DFAs are utilized in lexical analysis to efficiently recognize tokens, enhancing the performance of the compilation process.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware Design:</strong> In digital circuit design, minimized state machines lead to simpler and more cost-effective hardware implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Checking:</strong> Minimized DFAs aid in verifying system properties by reducing the complexity of the models, making verification processes more tractable.</li>
  <li><strong>Text Processing:</strong> Efficient pattern matching in text editors and search algorithms relies on minimized DFAs to quickly identify patterns within large bodies of text.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding and applying DFA minimization techniques, one can optimize various computational processes, leading to improvements in both software and hardware system designs.</p>
