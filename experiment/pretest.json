      "answers": {
        "a": "The language recognized by the DFA remains unchanged, but the DFA structure becomes more complex.",

        "c": "Minimization always changes the recognized language to a more complex one.",

      "answers": {
        "a": "Minimization is always beneficial in all cases.",
