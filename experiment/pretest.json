      "question": "Which of the following best describes the result of minimizing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The language recognized by the DFA remains unchanged, but the DFA structure becomes more complex.",
        "b": "The language recognized by the DFA is preserved, and the DFA structure is simplified with fewer states.",
        "c": "Minimization always changes the recognized language to a more complex one.",
        "d": "Minimization results in converting the DFA to a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Try again.",
        "b": "Correct! Minimizing a DFA preserves the recognized language while simplifying the DFA structure with fewer states.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Try again.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of eliminating equivalent states during the minimization of a DFA?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase the complexity of the DFA.",
        "b": "To reduce the number of states without changing the language recognized.",
        "c": "To convert the DFA into a Regular Expression.",
        "d": "To add more transitions for better recognition."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Try again.",

      "question": "When is it beneficial to minimize a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) in practical applications?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Minimization is always beneficial in all cases.",
        "b": "It depends on the size of the original DFA and the application requirements.",
        "c": "Minimization is only beneficial for non-regular languages.",
        "d": "Minimization is irrelevant for DFA."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Try again.",
        "b": "Correct! The benefit of minimization depends on the size of the original DFA and the specific application requirements.",
